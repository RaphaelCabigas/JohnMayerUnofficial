      "description": "Where the Light Is: John Mayer Live in Los Angeles is a live album and concert film by John Mayer, released on July 1, 2008. It captures his performance at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on December 8, 2007, during the promotional tour for his 2006 album Continuum. The concert features three distinct sets: an acoustic performance with Mayer and his band’s guitarists, a set with the John Mayer Trio, and a final set with his regular touring band.\n\nThe title comes from the song \"Gravity,\" which was a single from Continuum. The album was released in multiple formats, including CD, LP, digital download, DVD, and Blu-ray, with bonus content featuring backstage footage and Mayer playing outside on Mulholland Drive.\n\nMayer's acoustic cover of \"Free Fallin'\" was critically acclaimed and released as a single. However, two songs, \"No Such Thing\" and \"Bigger Than My Body,\" were performed but not included in the final release. \"No Such Thing\" was omitted due to Mayer singing an incorrect lyric, and \"Bigger Than My Body\" was likely left out because of a timing issue during the performance."

        "description": "John Mayer's fifth studio album, released on May 22, 2012, by Columbia Records. It marked yet another change in Mayer's musical style, incorporating elements of folk and Americana, as well as influences from Bob Dylan, Neil Young, David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash. Its cover, as well as that of the single 'Queen of California', was designed by David Adrian Smith. Born and Raised received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Mayer's technical skills as well as Don Was' production work. The first single 'Shadow Days' was released on Mayer's blog on February 27, 2012, and was made available for purchase as a digital download on March 6, 2012. The second single 'Queen of California' impacted Hot AC radio on August 13, 2012, and the third single 'Something Like Olivia' impacted Triple A radio on November 5, 2012."      },
