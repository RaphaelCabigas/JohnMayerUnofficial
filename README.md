# Web Development II

## Summative Assessment 2: Multi-Device / Single Page Application

You’re supposed to come up with a single page web application where you’d need to put together a responsive front-end using HTML/CSS together with a small back-end using Node.js framework. It could be anything from a storefront to an interactive experience, but make sure to run the idea through your tutor so it fits the template.

The application should work on a mobile as well as a desktop device. You are expected to have a sound understanding of what responsive design is all about, and it’s not just about visual beauty, but also interaction with users of the application. The application should be able to render static content, like stylesheets, images among others. Additionally, you would be required to implement one more thing, like a dynamic webpage, data to be pulled from a database, an API or a login system. Your work should be done using some of the recent techniques in web development.

You will need to design, implement as well as document the application in intervals. In the documentation, you must describe the steps you took and the reasons for the changes made incorporating images or screenshots of the process where possible. Wireframes, test plans, feedback from colleagues and commits on Git Hub could be used as the evidence of the process.
